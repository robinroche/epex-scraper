# epex-scraper
A basic script that scraps market data from EPEX-SPOT

IMPORTANT NOTE (04/2020): historical data is not available anymore, so the script is also not working anymore.

In the provided example Python script:
* pandas is used to extract price and volume data over a month from the hourly day-ahead market in the French area. 
* Data is then saved as a set of CSV files (one per day). 
* Data can then be plot and processed in Matlab.
